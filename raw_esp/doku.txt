I have started some work on reverse-engineering the wifi stack of the ESP8266. 
Currently I have been focusing on the libpp.a library, and have decompiled most 
of the important functions from wdev.c, and started a little bit on lmac.c
This is a tedious and error-prone process, 
so there might be mistakes creeping here and there. 
Please let me know if you find something interesting.
